# hello-world
the greatest front end web developer you've ever come across (in development). Soon I'll be saying Stand Back and Stand Down, I Got This .

should i be typing html here? 

i am a student of the world. "My heart's made of parts of all that surround me/And that's why the devil just can't get around me/
Every single night's alright, every single night's a fight/And every single fight's alright with my brain." --Fiona Apple. I am more on the quieter/introverted side more often than not. But I believe in saying yes to new experiences so I know how to rise to the occasion in safe spaces. In my free time I sew, read, game, sketch, knit, write, watch TV, do yoga and take long walks/hikes. I enjoy listening to classical music, trip hop, opera, rap, hip hop, pop, metal and the top 2 songs of every other genre.
